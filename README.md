# Frontend Mentor - Profile Card Component

This is a solution to the [Profile Card Component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/profile-card-component-oZetueUSuy). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The Challenge

Your challenge is to build out this profile card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Download the starter code and go through the  `README.md`  file. This will provide further details about the project. The  `style-guide.md`  file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.
